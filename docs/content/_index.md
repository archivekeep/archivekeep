# Archive Keep

_Keep your files archived on multiple places, in a reliable and simple way._

## About

The primary requirements and priorities of ArchiveKeep are to make process of **reliable archivation** to be simple and easy:

1. **safe replication** to other storages:
    - prevent propagation of redactions and deletion of files
    - prevent propagation of corruption and destructive changes of original information,
2. **offline storages** - external HDDs - have first class support,
3. **plain files** for direct access, maximum compatibility and convenience,
4. **optional server** with asynchronous online synchronisation.
