The primary requirements and priorities of ArchiveKeep are to make process of **reliable archivation** to be simple and easy:

1. **safe replication** to other storages:
    - prevent propagation of redactions and deletion of files
    - prevent propagation of corruption and destructive changes of original information,
2. **offline storages** - external HDDs - have first class support,
3. **plain files** for direct access, maximum compatibility and convenience,
4. **optional server** with asynchronous online synchronisation.

Extra about notes
-----------------

Things ArchiveKeep believes in:

- your data is entirely at your control,
- plain files for data and existing standards over custom formats,
- open source,
- no SPOF, including your laptop having access every online service,
- no destructive operation allowed unless action is explicitly confirmed.
