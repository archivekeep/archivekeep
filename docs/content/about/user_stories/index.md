Verification
------------

As an owner of data I can verify the integrity of stored files, so that I am assured, that files are not corrupted, or aware of issues to be solved.

As an owner of data I can resume interrupted-previous verification process, so I can continue verification of unverified files instead of re-verifying already verified files.


Hosting
-------

### Sharing

As an owner of a repository I can grant read-only access to other users, so that I can share archive contents directly without copying to some intermediate medium.


Other
-----

As a computer user I can perform operations on remote repository without re-entering my credentials on each command execution, so that I can work more efficiently without distractions.

As a computer user I am prevented re-adding a moved file as a new file unless I explicitly disable the check, so that I am aware of errors immediately rather than at sync time.

As a computer user I am prevented adding files with filenames incompatible with FAT-like filesystems, so that I am aware of the issue early rather than when doing sync with FAT-like storage.
