Verification
------------

As an owner of data I can verify the integrity of stored files, so that I am assured, that files are not corrupted, or aware of issues to be solved.

As an owner of data I can resume interrupted-previous verification process, so I can continue verification of unverified files instead of re-verifying already verified files.

As a desktop/laptop user I can perform operations on remote repository without re-entering my credentials on each command execution, so that I can work more efficiently without distractions.

As a desktop/laptop user I am prevented re-adding a moved file as a new file unless I explicitly disable the check, so that I am aware of errors immediately rather than at sync time.
