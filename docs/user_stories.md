Verification
------------

As an owner of data I can verify the integrity of stored files, so that I am assured, that files are not corrupted, or aware of issues to be solved.

As an owner of data I can resume interrupted-previous verification process, so I can continue verification of unverified files instead of re-verifying already verified files.
